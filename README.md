# Real-Time Image Detection and Classification

This project implements a real-time detection and classification model using Python. The application takes input images, processes them, and predicts the class or label of the image based on pre-trained machine learning models.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to detect and classify images in real-time, leveraging machine learning techniques. It can be used for various applications such as object detection, emotion recognition, or any task that involves analyzing and predicting the contents of images.

The project includes a Jupyter notebook for visualization and real-time detection implemented in Python. The model used for prediction is a pre-trained deep learning model.

## Features

- **Real-time Image Detection:** Process and predict the class of an image on the fly.
- **Pre-trained Model:** The model has been trained on labeled datasets to classify images into different categories.
- **Visualization:** Displays input images and the corresponding predicted label with visual output.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd repository-name
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **For real-time detection:**  
   Run the `real_time_detection.py` file:
   ```bash
   python real_time_detection.py
   ```

   This script will take an input image, process it, and predict the label based on the pre-trained model.

2. **Jupyter Notebook:**
   The notebook `Untitled.ipynb` can be used to explore the model's performance, visualize predictions, and make customizations. Launch the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Untitled.ipynb
   ```

   You can use it to test various images and see how the model predicts their classes.

### Example:

In the Jupyter Notebook:
```python
# Load and process an image
image = 'images/train/surprise/15.jpg'
print("Original image is of surprise")

# Get image features and predict
img = ef(image)
pred = model.predict(img)
pred_label = label[pred.argmax()]
print("Model prediction is:", pred_label)

# Display the image and prediction
plt.imshow(img.reshape(48, 48), cmap='gray')
plt.title(f'Prediction: {pred_label}')
plt.show()
```

## Technologies

- **Python 3.10**: Core language for implementation.
- **Machine Learning Libraries**: Libraries like TensorFlow/Keras (depending on the actual model) for real-time detection.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Used for exploration and visualization of model predictions.
- **Matplotlib**: For image display and visualization.
